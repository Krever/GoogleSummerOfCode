In this document, you can find a list of ideas that are proposed by the Scala Organisation for [Google Summer of Code 2025](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

# Application

If you are interested in becoming a contributor on any idea, please reach out to your potential mentor using their email address specified with the project. You can also reach Scala Center at [scala.center(at)epfl.ch](mailto:scala.center@epfl.ch).

If you would like to be a mentor and propose your own idea, please submit a PR editing this file (e.g. see [2024's projects](Past%20years%20ideas/2024.md)), adding your project to the list, following the format of other projects below.

# Rules

You can read the full rules of the program at the following links: [Rules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules), [Terms and Conditions](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/terms/contributor), [Help](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/help).

And here are the requirements for the potential contributor's proposal: [Writing a proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

However, here are some rules that we'd like to emphasize since they are not visible enough at the above links:

- The program is geared towards beginners first and foremost. It is intended to **be a learning experience** for people at the very beginning of their careers. It is also intended to **give an opportunity** to people who would otherwise not have one. It is NOT a freelance job. Therefore, when making an acceptance decision on a potential contributor, we will prioritize disadvantaged backgrounds and contributors at the very beginning of their careers.
- **IMPORTANT - EPFL Students**: Please note that, according to GSoC rules, there are restrictions on accepting students from an organization's host university. For Scala Center, the host university is EPFL. We can only accept up to 1 student from EPFL, so please take it into account if you're studying at EPFL and consider applying.

# Project Ideas

| Title                   | Scaladex: Support for Compiler Plugins |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Link to Project         | https://github.com/scalacenter/scaladex/ |
| Brief Description       | Add support for compiler plugins in Scaladex, the index website of open source Scala artifacts. Adapt the UI of the front page, search page and project page to allow searching, and browsing compiler plugins and their versions. See full description in [scalacenter/scaladex#865](https://github.com/scalacenter/scaladex/issues/865) |
| Expected Outcome        | Scaladex should index compiler plugin artifacts, such as [org.typelevel:kind-projector_2.13.16:0.13.3](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/typelevel/kind-projector_2.13.16/0.13.3/). It should show them as a separate platform on the front page, search page and project page. |
| Prerequisites           | Some experience with Scala and SQL. Good knowledge about HTML and css |
| Ideal Prerequisites     | Some knowledge of the Scala ecosystem, such as Scala platforms and binary versions |
| Expected Difficulty     | Medium |
| Expected Time Commitment| Medium project - 175 hours |
| Spoken Language         | English |
| Mentor                  | Kannupriya Kalra ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kannupriyakalra/), Email: [kannupriyakalra@gmail.com](mailto:kannupriyakalra@gmail.com)) |
