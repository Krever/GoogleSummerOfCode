# Rules

You can read the full rules of the program at the following links: [Rules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules), [Terms and Conditions](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/terms/contributor), [Help](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/help).

And here are the requirements for the potential contributor's proposal: [Writing a proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

However, here are some rules that we'd like to emphacise since they are not visible enough at the above links:

- The program is geared towards beginners first and foremost. It is intended to **be a learning experience** for people at the very beginning of their careers. It is also intended to **give an opportunity** to people who would otherwise not have one. It is NOT a freelance job. Therefore, when making an acceptance decision on a potential contributor, we will prioritize disadvantaged backgrounds and contributors at the very beginning of their careers.
- **IMPORTANT - EPFL Students**: Please note that, according to GSoC rules, there are restrictions on accepting students from an organization's host university. For Scala Center, the host university is EPFL. We can only accept up to 1 student from EPFL, so please take it into account if you're studying at EPFL and consider applying.

| Brief Description        | Scaladoc for Scala 3 has a modern UI and is developed to render static websites. We would like to use it to replace Jekyll in rendering the documentation website.                                                                                                                                       |
| Expected Outcome         | We would like a MVP of the website, generated via Scaladoc. We'd need to add support for some Jekyll features such as `include`, and our custom tabs liquid extension.                                                                                                                                   |

| Ideal Prerequisites      | familiarity with Jekyll, fundamentals of CSS and JS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Expected Difficulty      | Medium - We mostly expect pure engineering to bring in the needed Jeykll features, which can be tested on the present documentation sources. As a stretch goal the participant may want to work on styling the pages, create a plug-in system for Scaladoc, or work on incremental documentation builds. |
| Expected Time Commitment | Large project – 350 hours                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Scala CLI: scripting protocol

| Title                    | Scripting protocol for Scala CLI                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Link to Project          | https://github.com/VirtusLab/scala-cli                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Brief Description        | Extend Scala CLI with a scripting protocol that can be used to e.g. create source generators. (building on Bloop's built-in support)                                                                                                        |
| Expected Outcome         | You can build a Scala CLI project that will run a source generator (e.g. Protobuf or Smithy). Configuration of script is handled via directives or CLI args, script itself is a self contained scala cli project executed with main method. |
| Prerequisites            | Some familiarity with Scala, understanding of serialization                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Ideal Prerequisites      | Familiarity with Bloop and Scala-CLI, passion for developer tooling                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Expected Difficulty      | Medium - protocol needs to expose metadata that is compatible with Scala CLI, and to be extensible in the future (core components are already done, such as Bloop integration)                                                              |

| Brief Description        | At the moment, `ExplicitResultTypes` can only run against source files compiled with Scala 2, as its implementation relies on the Scala 2 presentation compiler. A [2022 GSoC added Scala 3 cross-compilation for all Scalafix modules](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/scalafix-cross-compiled-for-scala-3-gsoc-2022/6001), so we can now add and publish an implementation supporting source files compiled with Scala 3, leveraging [the stable Scala 3 presentation compiler API](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/stable-presentation-compiler-api/6139), [available in Scala 3.3.3 and later](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/tree/main/presentation-compiler/src/main/dotty/tools/pc). |
| Expected Outcome         | `ExplicitResultTypes` can run against source files compiled with Scala 3 (validated by an extensive Scala 3 corpus / test suite & smoke-runs on a couple of major Scala 3 projects). As a side effect, ability for rule authors to write Scalafix rules in Scala 3. As a bonus, potential ability to run, against source files compiled with Scala 3, `ExplicitResultTypes` along with community rules written in Scala 2 and published with TASTy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Ideal Prerequisites      | Experience with [SemanticDB](https://scalameta.org/docs/semanticdb/specification.html) and the [Scala 2 or 3 presentation compiler](https://www.chris-kipp.io/blog/an-intro-to-the-scala-presentation-compiler)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Expected Difficulty      | Medium - the stable presentation compiler API was added as an effort to upstream the mtags module from the Metals project, which provides a similar feature, so we do not foresee any contribution to the compiler, only integration work                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Brief Description        | Build a basic sampler, extending the current codebase as necessary to support this functionality.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Expected Outcome         | The minimum functionality to be able to load samples (e.g from [FreeSound](https://freesound.org/) or other source) and play them back. There are unlimited possibilities for extensions. The most basic features are pitch shifting, looping, and effects such as envelopes, reverb, and distortion. |
| Prerequisites            | Some basic knowledge of digital music and Scala.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Ideal Prerequisites      | Some knowledge of Web Audio would also be helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Expected Difficulty      | Medium. The basic project is quite simple but extensions have increasing complexity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Brief Description        | Build an audio graph library in Scala, that compiles to Web Audio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Expected Outcome         | Users can specify an audio graph (consisting of sound sources, transformations, and sink) and run it in the browser using Web Audio. Extensions would allow interactivity, such as controlling sounds from keyboard and mouse events, and changing the graph while it is running. |

| Expected Outcome         | The project has just been launched, so currently there is only a blueprint with the implementation of a handful keywords and combinators from `jq`. The goal of the student is to work towards completion of the implementation with the addition of new `jq` filters. |
| Prerequisites            | Basic knowledge of functional programming in Scala: algebraic data types, higher-order functions and type-classes. Basic knowledge of `fs2` or other streaming library of the Scala ecosystem (e.g. Akka Streams, ZIO Streams, etc.).                                  |
| Ideal Prerequisites      | Intermediate knowledge of functional programming: DSL embedding techniques and tagless-final, in particular.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Expected Difficulty      | Medium. Applicants will receive guidance to understand the architecture of the embedding and the fs2 implementation. The difficulty will largely depend on the complexity of the `jq` filters chosen for development.                                                  |
| Expected Time Commitment | Medium project – 175 hours                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
